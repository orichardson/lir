"""
Fixed-point check for the one-variable, two-CPD PDG.

Goal
  Verify that with r = s and γ = 0, repeated LIR steps (each time solving the
  inner μ* exactly) push the two unconditional CPDs p and q to agree, and that
  their common value equals the normalized geometric mean of the initial
  distributions p₀ and q₀.

Rationale
  In the 1-variable setting with two edges, the inner optimum is
  μ*(x) ∝ p(x)^{1/2} q(x)^{1/2} for r = s. Under envelope differentiation, the
  outer gradient update aligns p and q towards μ*. At convergence, p = q = μ*.

Test
  - Build the tiny PDG; snapshot p₀, q₀, and their geometric mean μ_geo.
  - Run a short LIR training loop (γ=0) that re-solves μ* every step.
  - Check that the learned p_T and q_T (i) agree and (ii) match μ_geo within a
    small tolerance.
